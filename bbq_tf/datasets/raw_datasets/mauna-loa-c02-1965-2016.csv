 standard version of the data most often sought.  The monthly values have been adjusted    ,,,,,,,,
 to 24:00 hours on the 15th of each month.  Column 6 gives the same data after a seasonal  ,,,,,,,,
 adjustment to remove the quasi-regular seasonal cycle.  The adjustment involves           ,,,,,,,,
 subtracting from the data a 4-harmonic fit with a linear gain factor.  Column 7 is a      ,,,,,,,,
 smoothed version of the data generated from a stiff cubic spline function plus 4-harmonic ,,,,,,,,
 functions with linear gain.  Column 8 is the same smoothed version with the seasonal      ,,,,,,,,
 cycle removed.  Column 9 is identical to Column 5 except that the missing values from     ,,,,,,,,
